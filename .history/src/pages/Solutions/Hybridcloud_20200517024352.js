                            Public cloud is what people think of when they hear
                            the word “cloud.” It’s ideal for application
                            development, scientific data processing, and
                            web-scale applications. On the downside, SLAs can be
                            weak and security can be limited. Exclusive use of
                            the public cloud becomes less economically feasible
                            as usage scales.
                          </p>
                          <p className="ptext">
                            Once applications hit a certain usage/cost
                            threshold, or have strict requirements, such as
                            security or data protection, that cannot be met by
                            the public cloud, organizations often consider a
                            private cloud. IT favors the private cloud for core
                            enterprise security; applications run on
                            infrastructure that is solely assigned to your
                            company and that facilitates auditing and
                            compliance. The reality is that most organizations
                            will need a blend of these options for different
                            purposes.

                            This is referred to as a hybrid cloud. It allows
                            organizations to use the public cloud where it makes
                            sense, to create private clouds to support certain
                            application types, and to use advanced techniques
                            such as cloud hubbing situating critical hardware in
                            network data centers in close proximity to telecom
                            providers, content distribution networks, and
                            application component providers to place their
                            applications optimally to ensure rapid response
                            time. Hybrid cloud automates and modernizes the
                            applications estate, places workloads in their
                            optimal location, embeds security, enables an IT
                            brokerage model and creates a simple, agile,
                            on-demand environment. Hybrid Cloud also lays the
                            foundation for embracing new technologies such as
                            containerization, serverless, platform as a service
                            (PaaS), IoT and edge computing all with an eye
                            toward improving business outcomes.

                          Ultimately, a hybrid IT environment enables a whole
                          new style of execution characterized by collaborative
                          development environments, consumer-controlled
                          personalized experiences, a cloud-first strategy, and

                          machine learning & AI.
                          <br /> <br /> For example, in a manufacturing
                          scenario, data from IoT sensors monitoring the
                          performance of machines on the factory floor can be
                          ingested using an edge computing infrastructure. Data
                          analytics is first performed locally; then the data is
                          transferred to a data lake in a cloud environment
                          where advanced analytics, AI and machine learning are
                          applied to larger data sets to gain critical insights.
                          These insights can be used to automatically initiate
                          actions in production & supply chain systems that
                          execute in a traditional infrastructure environment.
                          The hybrid IT components are managed in an integrated
                          fashion to deliver the end-to-end business processes.
                          <br /> <br /> As these examples demonstrate, the
                          potential benefits of hybrid IT are compelling, yet
                          there are notable challenges facing CIOs as they work
                          to embrace or accelerate hybrid cloud.

                        <p className="ptext">
                          From being able to migrate between clouds to
                          supporting local data regulations, hybrid cloud
                          enables the advanced level of management of computing
                          resources that is necessary to gain competitive
                          advantage in today’s business climate. However, simple
                          migration isn’t enough. It takes the ability to
                          seamlessly manage and move workloads and jobs between
                          clouds that provides the next level. Some of the
                          entry-level use cases for a hybrid cloud include:

                          There are increasing legal and regulatory requirements
                          for data storage and processing. For example, European
                          data protection laws require protections for personal
                          information that are significantly different from

                          and others create strict requirements on storage and
                          use of medical data. Utilizing a hybrid cloud is a
                          step in the right direction because you can use public
                          cloud providers in specific regions to support the

                          To deliver a good experience, enterprises need to be
                          as close to customers as possible, and they need to
                          understand how customers consume applications, as well
                          as what components (payments, ads, videos) are
                          required from outside sources. Using a hybrid cloud,
                          enterprises can set up multiple availability zones
                          under their control, connect with cloud service
                          providers in regional markets, and use edge computing
                          techniques to forge a direct connection to public

                            The first step is for CIOs to connect with the

                            and to set common goals. Within the IT organization,
                            CIOs must set policies that identify the need to

                            IT strategies. Then we recommend assessing the

                            roadmap to guide the journey to optimal hybrid
                            cloud. This roadmap should compare current and
                            future run costs to create a business case for
                            change; assess application and workload placement
                            and data locality options; recommend application
                            transformation requirements; consider IT policy and
                            operating model factors; and ultimately produce
                            clear, data-based recommendations with a proposed

                              Business units are often acquiring the cloud
                              services they need because IT moves too slowly. At
                              some point, those services must be integrated back
                              into the traditional IT environment for
                              operational and security reasons through a
                              services governance model that encompasses hybrid
                              IT elements. In addition, it’s important for CIOs
                              to have a handle on what the enterprise is
                              spending on IT services. The only way to
                              accomplish this is to adopt hybrid IT and
                              demonstrate to business units that IT can support
                              the pace and scale that the business requires.
